# HCAI_PROJECT
This repository integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) with a Random Forest-based hospital readmission prediction model. It maintains high predictive performance (Weighted F1-score: 0.73) while providing interpretable local and global explanations, improving transparency, trust, and decision-making in healthcare.
